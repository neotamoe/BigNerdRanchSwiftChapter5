# Big Nerd Ranch Swift - Chapter 5 - Switch
This chapter covers switch statements, ranges, value binding, tuples, where clauses, and if-case statements.

## Learning Highlights
* switch cases must be exhaustive
* control transfer statements like fallthrough modify the order of execution in some control flow.
* the fallthrough says to go to the bottom of a case to the next one.  
* range matching allows you to set a case to be a range of values 
* value binding allows you to bind the matching value in a certain case to a local constant or variable.  
the constant or variable is available to use only within the matching cases's body.
* type is a finite grouping of two or more values deemed by the developer to be logically related
* if-case allows focus on a single case of interest; no default case needed
